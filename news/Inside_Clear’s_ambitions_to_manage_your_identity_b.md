The reality is that every database of this kind is ultimately a target, and “almost every day there’s a massive breach or hack.”

But as Goode Intelligence CEO Alan Goode tells me, Clear’s early-mover advantage, particularly in the US, “puts it in a good space within North America … [to] be more pervasive”—or to become what Brill called “the one” that is most closely stitched into people’s daily lives.

Clear began growing beyond travel in 2015, when it started offering biometric fast-pass access to what was then AT&T Park in San Francisco. Stadiums across California, Colorado, and Washington, and in major cities in other states, soon followed. Fans can simply download the free Clear app and scan the QR code to bypass normal lines in favor of designated Clear lanes. For a time, Clear also promoted its biometric payment systems at some venues, including two in Seattle, which could include built-in age verification. It even partnered with Budweiser for a “Bud Now” machine that used your fingerprint to verify your identity, age, and payment. (These payment programs, which a Clear representative called “pilots” in an email, have since ended; representatives for the Seattle Mariners and Seahawks did not respond to multiple requests for comment on why.) Clear’s programs for expedited event access have been popular enough to drive greater user growth than its paid airport service, according to numbers provided by the company.

Then came the pandemic, hitting Clear (and the entire travel industry) hard. But the crisis for Clear’s primary business actually accelerated its move into new spaces with “Health Pass,” which allowed organizations to confirm the health status of employees, residents, students, and visitors who sought access to a physical space. Users could upload vaccination cards to the Health Pass section in the Clear mobile app; the program was adopted by nearly 70 partners in 110 unique locations, including NFL stadiums, the Mariners’ T-Mobile Park, and the 9/11 Memorial Museum.

Demand for vaccine verification eventually slowed, and Health Pass shut down in March 2024. But as Jason Sherwin, Clear’s senior director of health-care business development, said in a podcast interview earlier this year, it was the company’s “first foray into health care”—the business line that currently represents its “primary focus across everything we’re doing outside of the airport.” Today, Clear kiosks for patient sign-ins are being piloted at Georgia’s Wellstar Health Systems, in conjunction with one of the largest providers of electronic health records in the United States: Epic (which is unrelated to the privacy nonprofit).

What’s more, Health Pass enabled Clear to expand at a time when the survival of travel-focused businesses wasn’t guaranteed. In November 2020, Clear had roughly 5 million members; today, that number has grown fivefold. The company went public in 2021 and has experienced double-digit revenue growth annually.

These doctor’s office sign-ins, in which the system verifies patient identity via a selfie, rely on what’s called Clear Verified, a platform the company has rolled out over the past several years that allows partners (health-care systems, as well as brick-and-mortar retailers, hotels, and online platforms) to integrate Clear’s identity checks into their own user-verification processes. It again seems like a win-win situation: Clear gets more users and a fee from companies using the platform, while companies confirm customers’ identity and information, and customers, in theory, get that valuable frictionless experience. One high-profile partnership, with LinkedIn, was announced last year: “We know authenticity matters and we want the people, companies and jobs you engage with everyday to be real and trusted," Oscar Rodriguez, LinkedIn’s head of trust and privacy, said in a press release.

All this comes together to create the foundation for what is Clear’s biggest advantage today: its network. The company’s executives often speak about its “embedded” users across various services and platforms, as well as its “ecosystem,” meaning the venues where it is used. As Peddy explains, the value proposition for Clear today is not necessarily any particular technology or biometric algorithm, but how it all comes together—and can work universally. Clear would be “wherever our consumers need us to be,” he says—it would “sort of just be this ubiquitous thing that everybody has.”

A prospectus to investors from the company’s IPO makes the pitch simple: “We believe Clear enables our partners to capture not just a greater share of their customers’ wallet, but a greater share of their overall lives.”
