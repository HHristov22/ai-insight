Some of these Black Friday deals are even better than those we saw during Prime Day.

Aside from Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday is the best time of year to pick up an Echo speaker, a Fire tablet or a Kindle ereader from Amazon. While the online retailer typically saves all of the best discounts on its devices for the members-only sale events, it’s a safe bet that those deals will come back around for Black Friday. This year is no different: we’re seeing record-low prices (or close to them) on all of Amazon’s gadgets. These are the best deals you can get on Amazon devices for Black Friday 2024.
