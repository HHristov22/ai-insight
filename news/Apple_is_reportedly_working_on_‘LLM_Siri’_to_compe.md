The properties of something like OpenAI advanced voice mode and Siri are quite different. That OpenAI mode is great if you want to go ask a question about quantum mechanics and have it write a poem for you about it... It’s not going to open your garage. It’s not going to help you send a text message. There are many, many useful things Siri does for you every day, does them quickly and locally on your device. There’s a spectrum here, there’s a tradeoff across capabilities. Will these worlds converge? Of course, that’s where the direction is going.
