Renault Nissan Technology and Business Center India (RNTBCI) has inaugurated a new center in Bangalore as part of its RNTBCI 3.0 initiative, aiming to strengthen its position as a “Smart Carmaker.” This facility will drive advancements in Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) technologies and AI.

Debashis Neogi, MD & Board Member at Renault Nissan Tech Centre India, took to Linkedin to extend his congratulations to the Bangalore team who have been instrumental in driving this 2X expansion.

Renault Nissan Technology & Business Centre India (RNTBCI) is a key hub supporting Renault and Nissan globally. Established in 2007, it is located in Chennai, with additional offices in Hyderabad and Bengaluru.

This new center in Bengaluru combines Engineering Systems, Software, IS, and IT teams to improve vehicle features and operational efficiency, using AI and data. It also includes test benches, a car workshop, and high-speed fibre optic connectivity.

Karnataka hosts over 875 GCCs, over 30% of India’s total, employs 6 lakh people (35% of India’s GCC workforce) and contributes $22.2 billion annually. By 2029, the state targets 1,000 GCCs, 3,50,000 new jobs, and $50 billion in output.

RNTBCI (Renault Nissan Technology and Business Center India) was awarded the Rising Star GCC in AI at the Minsky Awards for Excellence at Cypher 2024, hosted by AIM Media House. The recognition was for its innovative approach and strategic use of AI to enhance operations and customer experiences.

Last year, Nissan and Renault announced plans to boost production and R&D, introduce electric vehicles, and transition to carbon-neutral manufacturing. Based in Chennai, the partnership produced six new vehicles, including two electric models, and established the Renault-Nissan center as a global export hub. The $600 million investment created up to 2,000 jobs.
